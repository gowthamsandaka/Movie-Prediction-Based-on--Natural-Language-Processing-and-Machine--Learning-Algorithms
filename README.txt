Title: Movie Prediction Based on movie scripts using Natural Language Processing and Machine
Learning Algorithms

Warning:
Few packages should be installed before running the jupyter file. Some commands are
listed below as follows:
1. pip install nltk
2. pip install scikit-learn

Objective:
The model predicts the close movie name by using input of random text.

Production Use:
The trained model can be used in the Over the Top platforms (i.e OTT).
Few Examples of OTT are Netflix, Amazon prime and Hotstar.


Note:
The jupyter file, saved models, and dataset file such as 48HRS,
Avatar, Avengers, Black-Panther... is 
placed under the same directory. Please make sure the
jupyter file location is not changed such that the code runs smoothly.
